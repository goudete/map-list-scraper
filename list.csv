Not only did I buy the apothecary cabinet but on a later visit, I purchased two vintage midcentury Hubley cap guns in heavy metal from a larger collection of them—holsters and all. What drew me into the store initially was a giant black surf board with the Chanel logo placed prominently across the center of the board. When I walked in I was dazzled by the rare architectural salvage, photography, art, jewelry, objects d'art, vintage clothing, motorcycle jackets and a giant punching bag made out of a Louis Vuitton leather print among other many extraordinary things curated throughout the space! I just recently purchased a third vintage Hubley Colt 45 cap gun from the same collection as the two guns I purchased prior. Aptiques modified this Colt 45 Hubley with a Louis Vuitton print on the handle! To say that I'm over the moon with this unique piece is an understatement.

My friend and I were a big fan of the Immersion Room, where you’re able to design your own pattern and project it onto the room. I found this to be a cool experience and a great creative outlet for me to explore.

Museums tend to have the visitor merely be the watcher of the exhibits, and not an active participant in the space. I feel this museum allows everyone of all backgrounds to get in touch with our creativity by literally having us use our senses to make something great.\n\nSome of the docents were also very helpful and informative. I spoke with one docent who showed us the Designing for Peace exhibit and we explored conversations about how peaceful designs transcend into various environments.

Other bars I was looking into had a better price point ... I should have went to those places and overlooked this one. The experience wasn't magical at all. Only one tv in the basement displayed the count down and a small group of us actually cared. I thought the whole place would have tuned into the count down and had the upstairs section involved as well.... but no the planners of this event treated it like a regular weekend, it was not festive at all in any way.\n\nThe drinks were GROSS! Bottom shelf liquor and extremely strong, disgusting drinks. There should have been a prefixed nye cocktail menu to order from instead of whatever the heck they were making behind that bar. I only had 1 cocktail and 2 glasses of champagne and so did my bf. We did not get our moneys worth for the drinks. Not to mention the horrible music and people! IDK what is was about the place the everyone in there thought they were too cool for school ,, like straight up the typical cliche LES a-holes!\n\nThe music was so bad. Not one moment at this bar felt like a new years celebration. And security was aggressive (which is not a surprise as I've been here once before and they were total jerks to everyone)!\n\nSO SO SO disappointed in this place and in myself for paying as much as we did to bring in the new year at the flower shop. I'm so upset honestly. Would've had a better time celebrating in my own home then taking a chance trying to get into a bar and paying for my drinks instead of being tricked into believing an open bar at the flower shop was actually worth it. It's barely worth coming here on a regular weekend.\n\nWe ended up leaving soon after the ball drop, didn't even stay the whole time.

THE SLICES IN THIS OTHER BOX MUST HAVE BEEN REHEATED MULTIPLE TIMES OR JUST WAY OVERCOOKED. it was very dry and had a slightly burnt taste.
