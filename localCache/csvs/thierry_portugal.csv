One of the main selling points of the hotel was the spa with a heated pool, however, upon arrival, we were disappointed to find that the pool was in fact cold and the wet sauna was also broken. This was a major letdown and did not live up to the expectations that were set by the hotel's marketing.\n\nOn top of this, the prices at the hotel were exorbitant, with the restaurant being particularly expensive. For example, we were charged 15€ for a dessert and the food was nothing special.Even the bread served as a covert was not good, which was surprising for a hotel that markets itself as luxurious.\n\nTo align with this atrocious experience, the “ acclaimed “ spa has zero control on children so there was constant screaming and crying ( ironically due to the cold water)\n\nTo make matters worse, when we complained to the hotel manager ( mariana ) about our experience, they only offered a massage as an apology( that was already booked and only offered after some persistence from our side). We had already decided to leave at this point, but even then, the hotel did not offer any sort of discount or compensation for our disappointing stay. The manager even had the audacity to suggest that we should be happy that we did not spend an extra night at the hotel.\nOverall, I would not recommend staying at Quinta da Comporta. The spa was not good, the prices were outrageous, and the hotel management did not seem to care about our experience or offer any sort of adequate compensation for our disappointment.\n\nIn conclusion prepare yourself for a journey with a 100€ meal ( no drinks ) with average food and dry bread, broken infrastructure, an ice cold interior spa pool and the most arrogant manager in the Alentejo area.

No check-in, no questions asked (anybody enters this house? yes).\nGot someone to show me where the room was and just took a bed. The room smelled to humidity and even had some mold in the corners. I found later that this was also happening in the bathrooms. Little to no storage space. Lockers? Nope. 6-bed dorm should be 4-bed due to size.\nThe kitchen was a complete mess all the time, which was extended to other common areas of the house. Blame it on the other guests, but also there was no one there to prevent this from happening since there was only a lady during the morning. Getting someone on the phone? Impossible. They don't pick up in any of the provided numbers.\nDue to the bad organization, the lack of information and the bad behaviour of other guests, ALL my food was thrown away from the fridge, even when it was correctly labeled with name and check out date. Then some of it appeared in a secondary fridge (staff one) and got an apology, but at this point I had already decided to leave the place.

And what an experience it is! For two people, I would recommend getting two to three starters (it’s hard to pick less than that and you will not regret it) and one or two main dishes (depending on how hungry you are, as the portions for mains are generous). The menu changes from season to season but never disappoints, as the products used are always fresh and the techniques flawless. The sandwich of “bochecha” is a show stopper and you can ask for a vegetarian option made with mushrooms (also mouth watering). The duck rice is a classic example of how this restaurant manages - time and time again - to elevate traditional Portuguese dishes. The same goes for any dish with octopus or cod. Truth be told, this is one of those places where you can order anything and be amazed. And what a pleasure that is!\n\nI lived in this region for most of my life and it is always a delight to return home and visit Avó Restaurante.

One of the staff members had intentionally switched them off, even though we still in the middle of a session. A male voice yelled out “Yo! We’re closed!” which took us aback as we were unaware of the shortened weekend hours. My trainer and I had to put away the weights onto the rack and navigate half of the gym in near complete darkness. We were concerned as we did not want to misplace the weights and have it fall on us, or trip on anything and injure ourselves.\n\nAs we approached the front desk on our way to the locker room, another young lady (who I assumed was a manager, Hispanic/Latinx, mid 20s to early 30s, plenty of tattoos) said “Listen, you gotta go. We’re closed.” We said that we understood, but did not appreciate the tone in her voice as she was very aggressive. As we were getting dressed, the same young man who yelled earlier (black man, early to mid 20s, wearing glasses) walked in and started checking all of the lockers making sure that they were clear, and slammed every locker door that he checked. It felt like he was trying to intimidate us and make us uncomfortable. When we left the locker room and we were walking toward the door, we asked what the operating hours were and the woman said “We close at seven, at seven the building is supposed to be empty”. We asked for her name and she refused to give it, so we left.\n\nI understand that as a business, you have set business hours. I also understand that your employees work very hard, and their quality of life is important to them. I myself am a store manager at a major sportswear retailer. My team and I like to close our business as quickly and efficiently as possible, but NEVER at the expense of safety or providing quality customer service.

Super quiet with a nice partial view of the ocean. Unlike when I’ve stayed in the old town part of Ericeria the hotel didn’t feel like it was on top of everything else around it. It had a huge under ground parking area and the walk to the center was 10-15m along the coastline. .\nThe sauna and steam rooms were small but I never met anyone else when I went to use them. They were clean and well maintained. The breakfast was buffet style and had a good selection with good hours. The pool was clean and heated. I never used the gym but it was well designed and looked like everything was clean and working.\nWhenever I needed anything from a surf board to sourcing something else in town the front desk staff was accessible by WhatsApp immediately which I really appreciated.\nThe downsides: I got a hot stone massage at the spa after seeing all the recommendations online of how good the spa was. The massage was terrible, the room was cold, the stones were cold and during the period I was laying there at the end the therapist started to clean the room and make a lot of noise going in and out. At some point I debating asking if we could just end the massage because I had requested firm and between the stones and her light petting, I was looking forward to it being over.\nThe sauna I used often but closes at 6pm which I found odd as most people use the sauna between 6-10pm. The front desk would leave it open longer but you had to request it daily and sometimes I did. They didn’t hesitate to adjust and did so happily.\nThe food I found at the restaurant to be very subpar for the price. I ordered a pizza and when I got it, they forgot the sauce and the dough was undercooked. Which for 16$ I’d expect they would of both cooked it correctly and not forgotten the sauce.\nIt’s possible that both the spa and restaurant are top notch during high season and they just have to figure it out during the off season but in that case for the price point of the hotel, they might consider closing for 1-3 months instead.\nThe hotel itself was nice, I’d very much consider returning.

Be aware the water can be cold but none the less refreshing. 3 stars are for the infrastructure or the services around it."",""time"":1652795942,""translated"":false},{""author_name"":""Björn Alenvik"",""author_url"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113915813019945629299/reviews"",""language"":""en"",""original_language"":""en"",""profile_photo_url"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5TiYpvJBOAhTbKFdCjvYXLU4eEr4C4BVsxUBS1YJQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3"",""rating"":5,""relative_time_description"":""7 months ago"",""text"":""Clean public beach with amenities and surf shops.\n\nIn case you are looking to surf, this is an great beach, especially if you are an beginner.\n\nParking spots available.\n\nThe restaurants are overall good."",""time"":1660491356,""translated"":false},{""author_name"":""Niva Grunzwieg"",""author_url"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103203941020916249319/reviews"",""language"":""en"",""original_language"":""en"",""profile_photo_url"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5TrJtpT-ITkYgESI37OtSlfjM49yJifwPCzgaQHwuM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3"",""rating"":5,""relative_time_description"":""7 months ago"",""text"":""Very nice beach and the Laguna/river near by makes it a very nice experience for kids.\nThe restaurants near the beach was nice and good."",""time"":1660502164,""translated"":false},{""author_name"":""Glenn Ross"",""author_url"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109960999439865284043/reviews"",""language"":""en"",""original_language"":""en"",""profile_photo_url"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SGYz8Fh1RyxmRmv9MevM2EJogX-LMM5kEKjYEIVw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo"",""rating"":2,""relative_time_description"":""7 months ago"",""text"":""Very surprised with the lack of resources available to the lifeguards at this beach.

During the conversation, it turned out that she was not examining the tooth that was hurting, she just did not understand me.  But even after she discovered a right problem tooth, she said that everything was the same just to drink antibiotics and painkillers for 8 days.  It seemed absurd to me because the tooth hurt so much that I could not touch it with my tongue from pain, I could not imagine how I would live 8 days with a bare nerve.  Immediately after this non-professional visit, I decided to go to another clinic, where I had a damaged tooth removed in 3 minutes without pain at all.  If I had listened to the treatment of a doctor from Medidental, I would have suffered for 8 days and it is not yet known what was with the tooth, perhaps an infection would develop there and there would be very sad consequences.

Both restaurants are owned by the same proprietor and offer the same high-quality Francesinha\n\nThe quality of the food is exceptional, with both the regular and vegetarian options being incredibly flavorful. I personally find myself choosing the vegetarian option more often, as it has a smooth texture. The sauce is the standout component, as it is thick, spicy, and has a delightful color.\n\nThe francesinha is large, and with the accompanying French fries, it can be difficult to finish in one sitting. However, it is worth noting that you can request a takeout box and take the remainder home, and the price difference is not significant. As an alternative you can just request an half instead of the full one.\n\nTaberna Belga also boasts a great selection of beers, with most being from Belgium, but also from other countries.\n\nThe staff are friendly and efficient, ensuring that diners are well taken care of.\n\nIt's important to note that the restaurant can be quite loud inside, which can be uncomfortable for some. During the summer, they open the outdoor seating area, which offers a more relaxed atmosphere.\n\nFinally, I would recommend visiting Taberna Belga before 7:30 pm, as it gets extremely busy and you may need to wait for a table. During the week, it's usually not as crowded, but weekends are always busy, and the waiting time can range from 10 minutes to an hour, depending on the time and size of your group. Despite this, I believe the wait is worth it, as the francesinha from Taberna Belga is a true ambassador of Portuguese cuisine.\n\nThe delectable Francesinhas, along with the friendly staff, vast beer selection,  make this restaurant a must-visit in Braga. With the perfect balance of taste and quality, the Francesinhas at Taberna Belga are truly one of a kind. Whether you're a local or a tourist, you're sure to have a memorable dining experience at this fantastic restaurant."",""time"":1675622819,""translated"":false},{""author_name"":""Shawna O'hara"",""author_url"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116726710481800847296/reviews"",""language"":""en"",""original_language"":""en"",""profile_photo_url"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5RwnY9qXb3eRpPWaWk1QcD5FIlA-uGf4yDuedVu=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo"",""rating"":5,""relative_time_description"":""8 months ago"",""text"":""Amazing Francesinha sandwich and great beer selection.

I actually think this works really well against the graffiti. While the graffiti isn't the high art style you might expect when you see the word, it just works. If I had to change anything, and this is just my opinion, I'd get rid of the spiral behind the DJ station and add more of the graffiti!\n\nAnyway. On to the drinks. The server popped over after a little while with a menu. There was a good selection of pretty good looking drinks but we went with a couple of whiskey ones in the end. They. Were. Great. Fantastic aromatics, excellent flavours that complemented the generous alcohol content and elevated the flavours of the drink. Not to start a flame war online but honestly, there was the exact amount of ice needed. For our second drink the server recommend something which was also delicious.\n\nThey were a friendly and knowledgeable bunch and if you're not sure what to get they're happy to help.

This refusal was despite of the fact that the hotel was not full at all and there were other available rooms online in 3 different sites. Amazingly, I was only offered ear plugs (!) and then I was even accused of having light sleep (!!). Very offensive and rude.\nThe day after, the hotel promised the problem is solved - but the at night the noise started all over again. In sum, second night without any sleep. This completely destroyed my vacation in Porto.\nAnd here is the worse part - they didn't even offer me any compensation or even a small gesture to make amend to having 2 sleepless nights on my vacation! nothing whatsoever. I even requested to leave the hotel, but they refused and said I can leave the hotel but without any refund, not even for the nights I didn't sleep because of the disturbing noise, and not even a partly refund.

By its name, we thought it would be a very sophisticated sushi place with all sorts of options and unique plates from someone who has a high level of experience in Japan with sushi cuisine.\n\nI am not sure if that is true or not because the offerings were not overly impressive. A lot of salmon, shrimp, and tuna, and not a lot else. Very sadly, there are other, less desirable sushi spots in Lagos with far more variety in seafood. No eel, no scallop, no octopus, no white fishes, no urchin, no clam, no crab. Just one type of tuna, salmon, and shrimp.\n\nThe tataki did not appear to be seared at all, or extremely little. Just covered in sesame seeds. (I have noticed in Portugal the idea that \""tataki = covered in sesame seeds\"" which is incorrect. Tataki has nothing to do with sesame.) It struck me as simply tuna sashimi with sesame seeds on it. It was very tender and smooth, which was very pleasant, but lacked the slight seared flavour and fragrance of tuna tataki.\n\nThe gyoza seemed like they came from a frozen manufacturer. I don't know if this is the case, but they tasted cheap. Also the wrapper was very thick. Gyoza wrappers should be thin, not thicker like Chinese potstickers.\n\nSalmon tartare was average also. The sauce was too sweet (most Asian sauces in Portugal/Europe are too sweet), but the salmon was fresh and the avocado base was very nicely made with bits of crunch for texture.\n\nWe had some other sort of wrapped tuna roll which tasted fine, apart from once again the sauce being too sweet, and it was sort of sloppy and hard to eat without it falling apart. Not very refined.\n\nWasabi had no heat and very little flavour to it at all. However, they did have good pickled ginger.\n\nI ordered a cappuccino and got what was more like a latte/galão... but it was so delicious! Very creamy, well-made latte. It was surprising that the best thing at a Japanese restaurant was the latte.\n\nIt was an okay meal, and probably the most ambitious and \""high end\"" Japanese food in Lagos, which is a very good thing. It is hard to find any good Asian food here anyway, and at least this place is trying to bring the level up. I hoped there would be proper variety. The chef (I think) was nice and asked about the food, so it is clear he is interested in feedback and making people happy. A very good sign.\n\nThis place does not even have a website. Just a Facebook page, which does not match with the concept of refined or upscale Japanese cuisine that a name like this implies. It is not a bad restaurant, but it is not nearly as sophisticated as the name would have people  believe. It is a fairly basic sushi place with very limited choices, but trying to do them better and more complex than other spots here.\n\nIf you like sushi and aren't super picky like I am, you will probably enjoy this a lot. It is trying hard to be good and different from those cheap/awful all you can eat buffet sorts of places here. This is the best I have had in Lagos so far."",""time"":1674928299,""translated"":false},{""author_name"":""adrian pike"",""author_url"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114379445686054294761/reviews"",""language"":""en"",""original_language"":""en"",""profile_photo_url"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxYg9vcUPzTACgjbR0Z88xG75eb5VtsJzxxlMZvT=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo"",""rating"":5,""relative_time_description"":""a year ago"",""text"":""We have just enjoyed a gorgeous sunset meal at this very special Japanese restaurant; the food was fresh, tasty and beautifully prepared and presented.

We further asked if we can have it with ice and he again declined and said “they are low on ice”. We eventually said ok to the bottled water which he clearly just wanted to sell to us. We later saw glasses of ice being served to other tables.\n2 - we were recommended to order up to 5 dishes due to being 2 people.

The portions were quite big, so we thought that the 5 recommendation was a bit excessive but still fairly enjoyed the first 2.\n3 - As soon as these were finished, we asked if we could change the remaining 2 which was denied because they had apparently started cooking it. Fair enough, however most people around us had ordered the same thing and we felt like this request could have been easily accommodated.\n4 - the final dishes come out and the duck was good but the cod à Brás was very underwhelming. It was extremely salty and soggy with no texture whatsoever.
